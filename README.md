# hackerrank-submissions

This repository contains my solutions to various HackerRank problems, organized into two main categories: **Python** and **SQL**. Each problem is stored in a separate subfolder, and the corresponding solution is provided in either a `.py` or `.sql` file.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

/ |-- Python/ | |-- Problem-1/ | |-- code.py
/ |-- SQL/ | |-- Problem-1/ | |-- query.sql 

- **Python/**: Contains solutions written in Python. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific problem, with the problem statement and `code.py` file containing the solution.
  
- **SQL/**: Contains SQL queries as solutions. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific problem, with the `query.sql` file containing the solution.
